# dialogue_summarization
Dialogue sumarization using generative AI. This lab focuses on dialogue summarization using generative AI. You'll explore how input text influences model output and apply prompt engineering techniques. By comparing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inferences, you'll gain insight into optimizing prompts to improve the performance of Large Language Models.
